Recommended Actions/Next Steps:  
No recommendations at this time.

Resolution:
No further actions are required for containment. 

Additional Notes:
If we are already country blocking how are you seeing sign-in attempts from out of country IP addresses?  
This is because it still shows the attempt in the log with a block from conditional access  

Feed back:
*We do not send customer advisories to Block IPs. We are their SOC. We implement the blocked IPs.
Shotgunning indicator lists to customers only scares them and IMMEDIATELY puts a panicked customer on our doorstep. 
We do NOT recommend blocks -- We make them.
